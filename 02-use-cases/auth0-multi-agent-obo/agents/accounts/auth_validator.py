Authentication and Authorization Validator for Accounts Agent

Validates JWT claims from inbound tokens and checks account access authorization.
Supports dual-issuer validation: tokens from Auth0 (direct invocations) and tokens
from the AgentCore Token Exchange Service (RFC 8693 exchanged tokens from coordinator
with attenuated scopes -- only accounts:* scopes should be present).
